# Oil_Recycling_Project
Oil Recycling Project - Code for Orlando

This project was created to encourage local businesses to recycle their cooking oils to reduce the volume that are improperly disposed of. Proper disposal of cooking oil requires businesses to spend on waste management fees which can be financially taxing, especially for small businesses. Unfortunately, businesses not willing to pay the waste management cost or simply cannot afford to do so resort to other methods to deal with the problem. 

Methods such as pouring the oil down drains causing corrosion to sewer pipes or reusing old cooking oil which is a sanitary problem as well as a fire hazard.

There is an alternative to using those environmentally damaging methods. Cooking oil can be converted to Biodiesel, an alternative to Petroleum (A liquid used to produce fuel cars, planes, and a variety of other machinery)

Biodiesel companies are widespread throughout the nation and are actually willing to pay for the cooking oil waste. 

The purpose of the project is to inform businesses because ultimately by connecting these industries, it is a way to positively impact the community.

Benefits:

- Pouring cooking oil down the drain or in the sewers cause corrosion to the pipes so the city is happy for having to spend less resources on sewer maintenance.
- Reusing cooking oil can cause sanitary issues and increase fire hazard. Customers are happy for cleaner foods and the fire department is glad for less fire related incidents.
- Restaurants avoid fines from the city from not properly disposing your oil and by selling their oil to Biodiesel companies, restaurants are happy for the increase revenue and less money on waste management.
- Biodiesel companies are happy for the increase supply allowing industry to grow.
- More availability of biodiesel means better incentives to use it as an alternative and reduce carbon emissions.

Goals:

Directly from www.biodiesel.com:

“The smartest technologies deliver benefits to multiple interests, including improved economy, and a positive impact on the environment and governmental policies.
The role of the biodiesel industry is not to replace petroleum diesel, but to help create a balanced energy policy with the most benefit to the United States. Biodiesel is one of several alternative fuels designed to extend the usefulness of petroleum, and the longevity and cleanliness of diesel engines.
The ultimate goal is to contribute to building a stronger, more self-sufficient community by way of a community-based biodiesel production model. A community-based biodiesel distribution program benefits local economies, from the farmers growing the feedstock to local businesses producing and distributing the fuel to the end consumer. The money stays in the community while reducing impact on the local environment and increasing energy security.”
