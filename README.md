# Oil_Recycling_Project
Oil Recycling Project - Code for Orlando

This project was created to encourage local businesses to recycle their cooking oils to reduce the volume that are improperly disposed of. Proper disposal of cooking oil requires businesses to spend on waste management fees which can be financially taxing, especially for small businesses. Unfortunately, businesses not willing to pay the waste management cost or simply cannot afford to do so resort to other methods to deal with the problem. 

Methods such as pouring the oil down drains causing corrosion to sewer pipes or reusing old cooking oil which is a sanitary problem as well as a fire hazard.

There is an alternative to using those environmentally damaging methods. Cooking oil can be converted to biodiesel, an alternative to Petroleum (A liquid used to produce fuel cars, planes, and a variety of other machinery)

Biodiesel companies are widespread throughout the nation and are actually willing to pay for the cooking oil waste. 

The purpose of the project is to inform businesses because ultimately by connecting these industries, it is a way to positively impact the community.

Benefits:

- Pouring cooking oil down the drain or in the sewers cause corrosion to the pipes so the city is happy for having to spend less resources on sewer maintenance.
- Reusing cooking oil can cause sanitary issues and increase fire hazard. Customers are happy for cleaner foods and the fire department is glad for less fire related incidents.
- Restaurants avoid fines from the city from not properly disposing their oil and by selling their oil to biodiesel companies, restaurants are happy for the increase revenue and less money on waste management.
- Biodiesel companies are happy for the increase supply allowing industry to grow.
- More availability of biodiesel means better incentives to use it as an alternative and reduce carbon emissions.

Goals:

Directly from www.biodiesel.com:

“The smartest technologies deliver benefits to multiple interests, including improved economy, and a positive impact on the environment and governmental policies.
The role of the biodiesel industry is not to replace petroleum diesel, but to help create a balanced energy policy with the most benefit to the United States. Biodiesel is one of several alternative fuels designed to extend the usefulness of petroleum, and the longevity and cleanliness of diesel engines.
The ultimate goal is to contribute to building a stronger, more self-sufficient community by way of a community-based biodiesel production model. A community-based biodiesel distribution program benefits local economies, from the farmers growing the feedstock to local businesses producing and distributing the fuel to the end consumer. The money stays in the community while reducing impact on the local environment and increasing energy security.”

Additional Information:

Directly from www.greenamerica.org:

"Studies show that biodiesel outperforms gasoline, ethanol, and conventional diesel in reducing climate-altering carbon dioxide emissions and in overall fuel-efficiency.

Using 100-percent biodiesel (B100) eliminates all of the sulfur emissions associated with conventional diesel, cuts emissions of carbon monoxide and smog-producing particulate matter almost in half, and reduces hydrocarbon emissions by between 75 and 90 percent. Perhaps most significantly, using B100 reduces the emissions of carbon dioxide—the main greenhouse gas causing global warming—by more than 75 percent. Even using a blended biodiesel fuel like B20 (a 20-percent biodiesel/80-percent petrodiesel blend offered at most biodiesel fueling stations) still reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 15 percent, according to the Department of Energy."
