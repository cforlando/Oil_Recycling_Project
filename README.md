# Oil_Recycling_Project
Oil Recycling Project - Code for Orlando

This project was created to encourage local businesses to recycle their cooking oils reduce the volume that are improperly disposed of. Proper disposal of cooking oil requires businesses to spend on waste management fees which can be financially taxing, especially for small businesses. Unfortunately, businesses not willing to pay the waste management cost or simply cannot afford to do so resort to other methods to deal with the problem. 

Methods such as pouring the oil down drains causing corrosion to sewer pipes or reusing old cooking oil which is a sanitary problem as well as a fire hazard.

There is an alternative to using those environmentally damaging methods. Cooking oil can be converted to Biodiesel, an alternative to Petroleum (A liquid used to produce fuel cars, planes, and a variety of other machinery)

Biodiesel companies are widespread throughout the nation and are actually willing to pay for the cooking oil waste. 

The purpose of the project is to inform businesses because ultimately by connecting these industries, it is a way to positively impact the community.
